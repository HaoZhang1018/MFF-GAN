#### Prepare data :<br>
Run "main.m" (the first function) to convert source images from RGB color space to YCbCr.

#### To train :<br>
Put training image pairs (Y channel) in the "Train_near" and "Train_far" folders, and run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py" to train the network.

#### To test :<br>
Put test image pairs (Y channel) in the "Test_near" and "Test_far" folders, and run "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test.py" to test the trained model.
You can also directly use the trained model we provide.
